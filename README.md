# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a comprehensive solution with a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend. The frontend, built with React, provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee data. Users can seamlessly add, update, and delete employee records. The frontend also includes advanced features such as sorting employees based on various criteria and exporting the data to Excel for efficient reporting.

On the backend, powered by Spring Boot, the system ensures robust data management. It includes APIs for handling CRUD operations, allowing the frontend to interact with the database. The backend is likely integrated with a database to store and retrieve employee information. Additionally, it supports fetching a list of employees along with their associated departments.

An exciting feature of the system is the incorporation of pagination in the frontend. This ensures that only a limited number of entries are displayed on each page, enhancing user experience and system performance. The pagination is seamlessly integrated, allowing users to navigate through different pages based on the number of entries.

The system also incorporates a column labeled "#" in the frontend table, providing a unique identifier for each entry. This column is dynamically generated and displays numbers sequentially from 1 to the total number of entries. This enhances the readability of the table and makes it easier for users to track and reference specific entries.
